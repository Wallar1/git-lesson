# Git lesson

This lesson covers the basics of version control.

This is part of the first lesson for CHEM280.

To make a commit (or "version" or "checkpoint") of your project, follow this procedure:
1. make changes / edit your files
2. Tell git you are ready to make changes by using `git add <file path>`
3. Create a checkpoint using `git commit -m "<your message>"

Use `git status` to see what changes have been made, and `git log` to see all of the commits for a project
